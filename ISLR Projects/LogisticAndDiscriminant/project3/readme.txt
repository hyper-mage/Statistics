I lost the questions for this project which leads to ambiguous documentation. I will do my best
to summarize what is going on in the project.

We do some exploratory data analysis (eda) on each dataset to determine correlation and responses.
For this project, we model linear discriminant analysis (lda), quadratic discriminant analysis (qda),
and KNN alongside some decision plots to determine which of these models is the best classifier
for the given dataset.

The last set of questions (3) introdcues logistc regression to the list of models used for this
project. We compare the sensitivity, specificity, ROC curves, confusion matrices, and accuracy
for the given dataset.

There are a couple different mediums for checking the outcomes, I suggest the Project3.html
due to the formatting.
